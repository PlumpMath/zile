                            ZILE-ON-GUILE

INTRODUCTION

Zile-on-Guile is a small text editor that runs in the console.

The editor is a fork of GNU Zile.  GNU Zile itself is a lightweight
editor in the style of GNU EMACS.  Zile-on-Guile's command set and
initial keybindings are very similar to those from EMACS.

EDITING COMMANDS

The editor uses commands that are very similar to EMACS commands.  For
those unfamiliar with EMACS, there are a couple of quirks compared to
most other families of editor.

Here are some conventional text editor vocabulary and their EMACS
equivalents.

In EMACS, 'kill' means 'cut'
yank -> paste
fill -> word-wrap
point -> beginning of selection
mark (as a noun) -> end of selection
mark (as a verb) -> select an area
region -> selection
find-file -> open file
write-file -> save file

Also, in the documentation of EMACS-like editors, it is commonplace
to use the abbreviation 'C-x' to mean Ctrl+x and 'M-x' to mean
Alt+x. The Alt key, for EMACS-like editors, is often called the 'Meta'
key, despite the fact that there hasn't been a keyboard with a 'Meta'
key for a few decades now.

Zile-on-Guile has the following editing commands available on startup.
