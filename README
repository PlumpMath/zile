INTRODUCTION
============

Guile-on-Zile is a lightweight EMACS clone.  It is a fork of the
official GNU Zile editor, with Guile support added.

Guile-on-Zile is in modern C and uses [ncurses][], [guile][] and
[libgc][]. Some portability is provided by using [gnulib][].

Source Layout
-------------

 * See file `AUTHORS` for the names of maintainers past and present.
 * See file `COPYING` for copying conditions.
 * See file `FAQ` for a selection of a Frequently Answered Questions.
 * See file `INSTALL` for generic compilation and installation
   instructions.
 * See file `NEWS` for a list of major changes in each Zile release.
 * See file `THANKS` for a list of important contributors.

The rest of the files in the top-level directory are part of the
[Autotools]() build system used to compile and install Zile.

 * Directory `build-aux` contains helper scripts used to build Zile.
 * Directory `doc` contains files used to create Zile's documentation.
 * Directory `gl` contains Zile specific patches to standard [gnulib]().
 * Directory `lib` contains [gnulib]() source modules used by Zile.
 * Directory `m4` contains a mixture of [gnulib]() supplied and Zile
   specific macros for rebuilding the `configure' script.
 * Directory `src` contains the source code used to build Zile.
 * Directory `tests` contains a small suite of tests used by
   `make check` to sanity check a newly built `src/zile` binary.

Web Pages
---------

Zile-on-Guile doesn't have a home page as such, but, it is on github
  > <https://github.com/spk121/zile>

GNU Zile's home page is at:

  > <http://www.gnu.org/s/zile/>

GNU Zile Development is co-ordinated from Ziles's project page at GNU
Savannah:

  > <http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/zile/>

An archive of past releases is also archived at:

  > <http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/zile/>

But please use a mirror for faster downloads and to reduce stress on the
main gnu machine. The following link will automatically redirect to a
nearest mirror:

Or you can manually select a mirror from the list at:

Mailing Lists
-------------

There isn't really a mailing list, but, you can contact the author
at <spk121@yahoo.com>.

See [REPORTING BUGS][] for the bug reporting mailing list address.


OBTAINING THE LATEST SOURCES
============================

If you are just building Zile-on-Guile from an [Official Release][], you
should not normally need to run `./bootstrap` or `autoreconf`; just go
ahead and start with `./configure`.

If you are trying to build it from the [Development Sources][],
`./configure` will not work until the `./bootstrap` script has completed
successfully.


Official Release
----------------

Any releases are probably somewhere around 
  > <https://github.com/spk121/zile/downloads>

Development Sources
-------------------

Zile development sources are maintained on Github:

  > [https://github.com/spk121/zile][gitbrowser]


REPORTING BUGS
==============

If this distribution doesn't work for you, I'm not surprised.  This
is a proof of concept hack, and probably won't be maintained.  Even
so, if you want to try to report a bug, e-mail me at <spk121@yahoo.com>
